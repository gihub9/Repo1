##A King and 7 Sons.

Once upon a time, there was a king who had seven sons.
One day they went for hunting and came back with seven fishes.
They let them dry in the sun. One of the fish didn't dry. 
When they asked the fish why it didn't get dry, it said "Hay stack blocked it". 
When they asked why Hay Stack blocked the sun, it replied, cow didn't eat it.
When they asked cow why it didn't ear the hay stack, it replied: "cowherd didn't allow it to eat". 
They go ask the cowherd, why he didn't allow cow to eat the grass, he replies that mom didn't fed him. 
They go to mother and ask why she didn't fed cowherd, she replies my little son cried. 
They again go to little boy and ask him why he cried, he replies ant bit him.
 When they ask ant, it says it bit him because he put his finger into the nest.
